You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Bike Streets is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place Bike Streets in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content.

However, if you do not elect to mark your Content as private or available for a limited group of members, or later change such designation to allow such Content to be made publicly available, you are responsible for the public nature of the content. Please review our Privacy Policy for more information on how to manage your privacy settings.

Claims of Infringement

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Bike Streets also reviews claims of trademark infringement. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Bike Streets infringe your copyright or trademark rights, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work or trademark claimed to have been infringed (or, if multiple copyrighted works or trademarks located on the Services are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Bike Streets to locate the material on the Services; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright or trademark owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Please be advised that Bike Streets will not respond to complaints that do not meet these requirements. If Bike Streets determines that the materials alleged to infringe your copyright or trademark rights do not require removal, Bike Streets will remove those materials only pursuant to a court order declaring the content or use of the materials unlawful.

If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Counter-notices must include the following information: (a) your name, address, and telephone number; (b) the source of the content that was removed; (c) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the content was removed in error; (d) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located; or, if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Bike Streets may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the original complaint; and (e) a physical or electronic signature (for example, typing your full name).

Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Services must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA (see http://copyright.gov/title17/92appb.html) and should be sent to the agent identified below. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there may be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

You agree to indemnify and hold Bike Streets and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, representatives, employees, partners and licensors harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, made by any third party arising out of, resulting from or relating to any claim, action or cause of action for infringement, misappropriation or violation of any patent, trademark, service mark, trade secret, know-how or other intellectual property right due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit or otherwise seek to make available through the Services, your use of the Services, your violation of the Terms, and/or your violation of any rights of another person or entity.

Dispute Resolution

Mandatory Arbitration

Except as prohibited by law,  all disputes arising under or related to this Release and Waiver which cannot be resolved through negotiations between the parties shall be submitted to binding arbitration. If the parties fail to reach a settlement of their dispute within fifteen (15) days after the earliest date upon which one of the parties notified the other(s) of its desire to attempt to resolve the dispute, then the dispute shall be promptly submitted to arbitration by a single arbitrator through the Judicial Arbiter Group ("JAG"), any successor of the JAG, or any similar arbitration provider who can provide a former judge to conduct such arbitration if JAG is no longer in existence.  If the parties are unable to agree upon the arbitrator, the arbiter shall be selected by the scheduling coordinator for JAG on the basis, if possible, of his or her expertise in the subject matter(s) of the dispute. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final, non-appealable and binding upon the parties, and it may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration shall take place in Denver, Colorado.  The arbitrator shall be bound by the laws of the State of Colorado applicable to the issues involved in the arbitration and all Colorado rules relating to the admissibility of evidence, including, without limitation, all relevant privileges and the attorney work product doctrine. All discovery shall be completed in accordance with the time limitations prescribed in the Colorado rules of civil procedure, unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the arbitrator on the basis of strict necessity adequately demonstrated by the party requesting an extension of time. The arbitrator shall have the power to grant equitable relief where applicable under Colorado law, and shall be entitled to make an award of punitive damages when applicable under Colorado law. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion setting forth his or her decision and the reasons therefor within thirty (30) days after the arbitration proceeding is concluded. The obligation of the parties to submit any dispute arising under or related to this Release and Waiver to arbitration as provided in this Section shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Release and Waiver. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek and obtain an injunction or other appropriate relief from a court only to preserve or protect trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property or confidential information or to preserve the status quo with respect to any matter pending conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, but no such application to a court shall in any way be permitted to stay or otherwise impede the progress of the arbitration proceeding. 

The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

Class-Action Waiver

The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only, and not as a class action or other representative action. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

Time Limitation on Claims

You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with Bike Streets and these Terms must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.
